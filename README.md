# Cisco Intersight Physical Infrastructure provider documentation (maintainer notes)

This repository contains documentation related to Cisco Intersight Physical Infrastructure  provider.

**NOTE**: *README.md is intended for documentation maintainers only and should
not be included in the final PDF nor shipped to customers. All .adoc files,
however, are actually a part of the documentation.*

## Compile into PDF
First navigate to [master.adoc](./intersight_provider_guide/master.adoc) and uncomment
appropriate variable set (either ManageIQ or CloudForms).

Then install [`asciidoctor-pdf`](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-pdf)
gem and use it like this to compile `.adoc` documentation into a PDF file:

```bash
bundle exec asciidoctor-pdf intersight_provider_guide/master.adoc -o ./PREVIEW.pdf
```

This command will create file `./PREVIEW.pdf` that can be used as documentation
preview.

## Documentation guides
When adding new sections to the documentation, we need to follow some guides in
order to be as compatible with other documentation as possible.

### Menu navigation
Menu navigation must be bolded and use `ITEM -> ITEM` syntax.

Correct: **User -> Settings -> Profile**

Wrong:

- *User -> Settings -> Profile* (because it's italics)
- **User>Settings>Profile** (wrong separator)
- **User->Settings->Profile** (missing spaces)

### Referencing form fields
Any references must be bolded. Please do not use italics, nor quotes.

Correct: Select option **VMware WebMKS** in **Remote Console** section.

Wrong:

- Select option "VMware WebMKS" in **Remote Console** section. (because of "")
- Select option *VMware WebMKS* in **Remote Console** section. (because it's italics)

### Capitalize titles and lists
Titles must have all nouns capitalized. Furthermore, list items must have a form
of sentence, not just plain nouns.

Correct:
- Catalog, service dialog and catalog item preparation.
- Catalog item ordering with customization.
- Order approval, which results in actual provisioning to happen.

Wrong (because items are not nice sentences):
- catalog, service dialog and catalog item preparation
- catalog item ordering with customization
- order approval, which results in actual provisioning to happen

### Use variable for product names `{vcd}`, `{product-title}` etc.
We introduced it as an **asciidoc variable** defined in
[master.adoc](intersight_provider_guide/master.adoc) along with some other handy variables
that are available in all subsequent sections. Do use them!

Also, please pay attention to difference between:

- `:product-title:           Red Hat ManageIQ` (a product)
- `:product-appliance:       ManageIQ appliance` (a concrete virtual machine instance with MIQ, addressible by IP)
- `:intersight:                 Intersight` 
- `:intersight-provider:        {intersight} provider` (refers to Cisco Intersight provider integration into MIQ - with inventoring, eventing and all)

Do not mix them because it makes documentation very difficult to follow then.

Correct: "{intersight-provider} supports listing available physical servers, racks, switches and chassis." 
(value will be inserted upon PDF creation)

Wrong: "Intersight provider supports listing available physical servers, racks, switches and chassis."
(because it hardcodes the "Intersight provider" string)

### Reference to other sections
Please do not use links when referencing to other sections of our documentation because links don't work in PDF. Use anchors instead.

Correct: "More details on this matter can be found in \<\<AddingAnIntersightProvider\>\> section."
(link will be inserted upon PDF creation)

Wrong: "More details on this matter can be found in link:vcd-vapp-provision.adoc[vApp Provisioning in vCloudDirector through Red Hat ManageIQ] section."
(because it uses direct link that won't work in PDF. Moreover, it hardcodes the link title. Using anchor uses
the document title.)

### Don't title images
Images don't have titles in CFME docs therefore we shouldn't be creating them either IMAO. Not sure on this
one. You can still add `alt` attribute.

Correct: image::../../images/vcd-vapp04-itemtype.png[alt="Select Orchestration stack"]
(`alt` attribute won't be rendered)

Wrong: image::../../images/vcd-vapp04-itemtype.png[title="Select Orchestration stack"]
(because image has title rendered)
